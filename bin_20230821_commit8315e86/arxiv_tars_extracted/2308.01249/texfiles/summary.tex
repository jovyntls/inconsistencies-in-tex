\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we have discussed the application of SC-LDPCL ensembles for scalable optical communication systems with SDM. We have adapted the SC-LDPCL to the new application scenario and proposed the semi-joint decoder for decoders that are distributed on multiple processors together with two variants: The first variant improves the BER performance without increasing the information exchange, and the second reduces the information exchange significantly with only small performance penalty.
