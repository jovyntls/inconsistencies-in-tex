\begin{abstract}
With the surge of theoretical work investigating Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) for wireless communication and sensing, there exists an urgent need of hardware solutions for the evaluation of these theoretical results and further advancing the field. 
%
The most common solutions proposed in the literature are based on varactors, Positive-Intrinsic-Negative (PIN) diodes, and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). 
%
This paper presents the use of Liquid Crystal (LC) technology for the realization of continuously-tunable extremely large millimeter-wave RISs. 
%
We review the basic physical principles of LC theory, introduce two different realizations of LC-RISs, namely reflect-array and phased-array, and highlight their key properties that have an impact on the system design and RIS reconfiguration strategy.   
%
Moreover, the LC technology is compared with the competing technologies in terms of feasibility, cost, power consumption, reconfiguration speed, and bandwidth. 
%
Furthermore, several important open problems for both theoretical and experimental research on LC-RISs are presented.
%\ara{a bit about RISs --> research is moving from theory to prototyping and experiments--> Most of these are pin-based, varactors, RF-switches...--> they show RIS is possible... but also initial cost estimates are prohibitive--> Then LC has proven effective in EM/Antenna design community, benefit scalability, low cost, continuous phase shift, but challenges too...  }
% With the rise of models describing the potential and limitations of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), also known as tunable reflect- and transmitarrays, in wireless communication and sensing channels, numerous hardware solutions are being developed. 
% The most common solutions are based on varactors, Positive-Intrinsic-Negative (PIN) diodes, and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). 
% Recently, several works on 1-bit nematic Liquid Crystal (LC) RISs have been published.
% This paper presents the use of LC technology for the realization of continuously tunable mm-Wave RISs to address the increasing interest in this technology. 
% Starting from basic LC theory, we introduce two different realization methods, the reflectarray and the phased array method. 
% Comparing LC technology to the competing technologies, we see that the main advantage is the feasibility and low-cost potential of large panels, followed by a low-power consumption. 
% However, there are some challenges that the LC technology faces such as its comparably slow response times in the order of 10s of milliseconds, the insertion losses,  temperature dependence, and bandwidth.
% With this in mind, we analyze for which applications LC-based RISs are best suited. \alejandro{We don't do it anymore?}

% To do/check:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Let's check if a biography is still mandatory. If not, we can drop it.

% \item Intro: \ara{@AJS:Is there something with mems?}

% \item RA: \ara{we should unify response time and tuning time. AFAIK they are the same right?}

% \item Notation: consistent use of phase-shifter (or phase shifter), response time (or tuning time)

% \item SC: \ara{@AJS: Don't we mention temp as a challenge for LC-RIS?}

% \item MEMS: \ara{@AJS: is this discrete?}

% \item Overhead: \ara{@VJ: One can argue the overhead remains the same. In the end, the mmWave 5G NR has all these procedures in the standard. } 

% \item Fig. 4: \ara{I would suggest 1) arranging the figures page wide, reducing the size of the figures by ~30-50\%, increasing the number of figures according to see the transitions and then adding some labels on the figure showing the current and desired direction and perhaps a red circle around the interference directions.} \vahid{@MD: I agree with Arash, you can consider 5 figures in a row to better illustrate the transition.}

% \item Fig. 4: \vahid{@MD: In addition to the comments by Arash, please ensure that the figure data is consistent with the text. There, it is stated that NRCS (in dB) is plotted, is this what we plot in Fig. 4? The numbers seem too low to me. Please add the values for the desired reflection angles in the caption.}
