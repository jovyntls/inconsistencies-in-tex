Reference \cite{b1} presented an algorithm to solve the problem of finding the values $\theta_1,
\theta_2, \ldots, \theta_N$ to maximize $| h_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N h_n e^{j\theta_n} |$ where $\theta_n
\in \Phi_K$ and $\Phi_K = \{\omega, 2\omega, \ldots, K\omega\}$ with $\omega=\frac{2\pi}{K}$ and
$j=\sqrt{-1}$. The
set $\Phi_K$ can equivalently be described as $\{ 0, \omega, 2\omega, \ldots , (K-1)\omega\}$. In
\cite{b1}, the values $h_n\in \mathbb{C}$, $n=1,2,\ldots,N$ are the channel coefficients and
$\theta_n$ are the phase values added to the corresponding $h_n$ by an intelligent reflective
surface (IRS), also known as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS).
